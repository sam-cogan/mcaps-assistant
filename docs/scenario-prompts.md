# Scenario Prompts

Copy-paste any of these into the Copilot chat window after you've started the MCP servers. Each prompt triggers one or more skills automatically — you don't need to name the skills, just describe what you need.

## Multi-Skill Chain Prompts

These are realistic "day in the life" prompts that chain **multiple skills** in sequence. This is where the full orchestration shines:

> **Full weekly review (Specialist)**
>
> `I'm a Specialist. Run my full weekly review — pipeline hygiene, any deals ready to hand off, and flag risks across my active opps.`
>
> *Chains: pipeline-hygiene-triage → handoff-readiness-validation → risk-surfacing*

> **Pre-governance prep (CSAM)**
>
> `Before my Contoso governance meeting Thursday, tell me: what stage are we really in, what's the milestone health, and prepare a customer evidence pack for the last 30 days.`
>
> *Chains: mcem-stage-identification → milestone-health-review → customer-evidence-pack*

> **Commit-or-loopback decision (CSAM/CSA)**
>
> `The team wants to commit the Fabrikam milestone, but I heard the proof had issues. Check if we should commit or loop back, and tell me who owns what.`
>
> *Chains: commit-gate-enforcement → non-linear-progression → delivery-accountability-mapping*

> **End-to-end deal triage (Any role)**
>
> `The Northwind deal feels stuck. What stage is it actually in, are exit criteria met, what are the risks, and who should own the next action?`
>
> *Chains: mcem-stage-identification → exit-criteria-validation → risk-surfacing → role-orchestration*

> **Post-proof handoff (CSA → CSAM)**
>
> `I'm a CSA. The Contoso proof just completed successfully. Check architecture feasibility, create the handoff note, and validate that the Specialist handoff is clean.`
>
> *Chains: architecture-feasibility-check → architecture-execution-handoff → handoff-readiness-validation*

> **Adoption + expansion review (CSAM)**
>
> `Review adoption health for Fabrikam, check if value is being realized on committed milestones, and flag any expansion signals that should go to the Specialist.`
>
> *Chains: adoption-excellence-review → value-realization-pack → expansion-signal-routing*

> **Power BI portfolio review**
>
> `Run my Azure portfolio review — what's my gap to target and which opportunities should I focus on?`
>
> *Uses: pbi-azure-portfolio-review prompt (Power BI + CRM cross-medium)*

> **Morning standup prep (SE)**
>
> `I'm an SE. Check my task hygiene, show me any execution blockers on committed milestones, and tell me if there are Unified constraints I should flag today.`
>
> *Chains: task-hygiene-flow → execution-monitoring → unified-constraint-check*
