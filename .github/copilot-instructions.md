# Copilot Instructions for MSX Helper MCP

> **Layer model**: User-level `~/.github/copilot-instructions.md` defines the assistant persona,
> file routing, and MCP server intent. This file adds workspace-specific operational rules that
> apply when the full skill library is loaded (via mcaps CLI `--add-dir` or this workspace).
> Do not duplicate user-level behavior here.

## Intent (Resolve First)

The agent strengthens cross-role communication and strategic alignment for account teams. MSX is one medium — not the mission. For the full model, see `.github/instructions/intent.instructions.md`.

**Operational checklist — every request:**
1. **Resolve order**: Intent → Role → Medium → Action → Risk check.
2. **Cross-ref ≥2 mediums** for status/risk/next-steps (CRM + M365 or vault). State sources; flag stale or silent mediums.
3. **Surface risk proactively** — one sentence, cite evidence, name the role to act, suggest minimum intervention.
4. **Connect rooms**: Bring context from separated mediums/roles together so the full value reaches the person who needs it.
5. **Match to availability**: Only promise synthesis for mediums confirmed queryable (see Medium Probe below).
6. **Strategic lens** (when request touches account state): pipeline health · execution integrity · customer value · cross-role coverage · risk posture.

## Medium Availability Probe

At session start, probe: CRM (`crm_whoami`), Vault (`get_vault_context`), WorkIQ (`ask_work_iq`), Teams (`ListTeams`), Mail (`SearchMessages` with `received:today top:1`), Calendar (`ListCalendarView` today), Power BI (`ExecuteQuery` with `EVALUATE TOPN(1, 'Dim_Calendar')`). Cache results; two-medium minimum; single-medium must flag the gap.

## Default Behavior

- Prefer MCP tools over local scripts. Use `msx-crm` from `.vscode/mcp.json` for read/write operations.
- If an MCP tool fails, retry with corrected parameters first. Local diagnostics only when explicitly requested.
- Derive missing identifiers via MCP read tools (e.g., `crm_whoami`) — do not create ad-hoc scripts.

## Personal Context

Sam's identity, working patterns, and global defaults (e.g. Azure region) → user-level `~/.github/instructions/personal-context.instructions.md`. Always use `swedencentral` for Azure resources.

## Vault-First Scoping

For account-specific work, if OIL is available, start in the Obsidian vault before querying live systems.

## Personal Productivity (Obsidian + Things 3)

The vault serves two purposes: **CRM context** (via OIL tools — see `obsidian-vault.instructions.md`) and **personal project management** (via direct Obsidian MCP tools — see `obsidian-project-management.instructions.md`). These are complementary interfaces to the same vault.

- **Project management**: PARA folder layout, hub notes at `1. Projects/{Name}/{Name}.md`, status tracking. See `obsidian-project-management.instructions.md`.
- **Things 3**: Task manager with areas (Customer Work, CSA Work, Community, Admin), tags (`@waiting`, `@deep-work`, sizing), and known MCP gotchas. See user-level `~/.github/instructions/things3-mcp.instructions.md`.
- **Prompts**: `New project`, `Status update`, and `Weekly review` prompts orchestrate cross-system workflows between Obsidian and Things.

## MSX/CRM Operations

**Role mapping (mandatory before guidance or write-intent planning):**
- Capture the user's MSX role up front: Specialist, SE, CSA, or CSAM. If not confirmed, present options. If inferable from `crm_whoami`, present and confirm.
- MCEM stages → `mcem-flow.instructions.md`. Shared patterns → `shared-patterns.instructions.md`.

**CRM query discipline:**
- Use GUID (`opportunityid`) for tool parameters; display `msp_opportunitynumber` as `Opp #`. Never guess property names — verify via `crm-entity-schema.instructions.md`.
- Query scoping → `crm-query-strategy.instructions.md`. Write-intent → `msx-role-and-write-gate.instructions.md`.
- Stage: `msp_activesalesstage`. Close date: `msp_estcompletiondate` (fallback `estimatedclosedate`). Deal team: `msp_dealteams`.

**WorkIQ**: Narrow scope before retrieval; resolve role first. **M365 Native**: Use Teams/Mail/Calendar MCP for targeted single-source ops; WorkIQ for broad discovery. See `shared-patterns.instructions.md` § M365 Communication Layer.

**Vault (OIL)**: Customer context and durable memory. Operate statelessly if unavailable. **Connect Hooks**: `connect-hooks.instructions.md`. **Power BI**: Use `@pbi-analyst` subagent for medium/heavy DAX; see `powerbi-mcp.instructions.md`.

## Response Expectations

- Concise, action-oriented. Structured tables for milestone/opportunity results — never prose-only.
- Milestone columns: `Name`, `Monthly Use`, `Due Date`, `Status`, `Owner` (mandatory), `Blocker/Risk`, `Link`.
- Opportunity columns: `Opp #` (CRM deep-link on `msp_opportunitynumber`), `Name`, `Monthly Use`, `Stage`, `Estimated Close Date`, `Health/Risk`, `Next Step`, `Deal Team`. No separate `Link` column.
- Unavailable fields: show `Unknown`, note retrieval method. `Deal Team` unavailable → note `msp_dealteams` gap.
- `get_my_active_opportunities`: deal-team-first discovery; `relationship` tag per opportunity (`owner`, `deal-team`, `both`).

**Morning brief**: Trigger with "morning brief", "start my day", or "catch me up" to run the speed-optimized daily briefing workflow.

**Skill loading**: Auto-loaded by description match. If a chained skill is missing, read from `.github/skills/{name}/SKILL.md`. Execute multiple skills sequentially; reuse tool outputs. Chains → `shared-patterns.instructions.md`.
