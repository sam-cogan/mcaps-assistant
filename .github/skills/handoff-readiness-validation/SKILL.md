name: handoff-readiness-validation
description: 'Handoff readiness validation for STU-to-CSU transfer: verifies the Specialist populated business-case summary, measurable outcomes, proof artifacts, CSU-aligned owners, and next-action items before disengaging. Returns populated/missing per field. Chains with pipeline-hygiene-triage and risk-surfacing for weekly pipeline review; chains with architecture-feasibility-check and architecture-execution-handoff for post-proof handoff. Triggers: Specialist departure, STU leaves, transfer checklist, STU-to-CSU handoff, readiness validation, ready to hand off.'

## Purpose

Ensures clean STU→CSU handoff by validating that committed milestones have explicit owners, measurable outcomes, proof artifacts, and documented next actions before Specialist disengages.

## Freedom Level

**Low** — Handoff quality gate. No handoff-ready declaration without passing all checks.

## Trigger

- Customer agreement reached or commitment flips to committed
- Specialist asks "is this ready to hand off?" or "handoff check"
- Stage 3 exit criteria include clean STU→CSU transition

## Flow

1. Call `msx-crm:get_milestones` with `opportunityId` — isolate committed or commitment-candidate milestones.
2. For each milestone, call `msx-crm:get_milestone_activities` to verify task hygiene:
   - Owner is CSU-aligned (CSAM or CSA), not still STU
   - Due dates are realistic and set
   - Measurable outcome signal exists (`msp_monthlyuse` or task completion criteria)
3. Call `msx-crm:crm_get_record` on opportunity for stage alignment and success plan linkage.
4. Validate handoff artifact completeness (see checklist below).
5. If gaps found, generate dry-run `msx-crm:create_task` payloads for remediation.

## Handoff Checklist

- [ ] Why customer bought (business case summary)
- [ ] What success looks like (measurable outcomes)
- [ ] What was promised and explicitly out of scope
- [ ] Proof artifacts and customer agreement evidence are findable
- [ ] CSU-aligned owner assigned to each committed milestone
- [ ] Next 2–3 actions are assigned and dated
- [ ] Clear cadence: next meeting, stakeholders, escalation path

## Decision Logic

- **Ready**: All checklist items satisfied → handoff-ready
- **Not ready**: Any checklist gap → block handoff, list specific gaps
- **Owner mismatch**: Milestone still STU-owned post-commitment → flag for reassignment

## Output Schema

- `ready`: boolean
- `blocking_gaps`: list of missing items from checklist
- `handoff_note`: structured Specialist → CSAM/CSA summary
- `draft_tasks`: dry-run task payloads for gap closure
- `next_action`: If ready → "STU→CSU handoff validated. Next step is `delivery-accountability-mapping`, owned by CSAM. Recommend notifying the CSAM to initiate Stage 4."
