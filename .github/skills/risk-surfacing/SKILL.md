description: 'Deal-risk radar: synthesizes field data, vault notes, and calendar signals to flag relationship decay, silent stakeholders, and looming threats. Proactive early-warning system, not a document compiler. Chains with pipeline-hygiene-triage and handoff-readiness-validation for weekly pipeline review; chains with mcem-stage-identification and exit-criteria-validation for full deal triage. Triggers: deal risk, risk radar, threat flag, warning signal, silent stakeholder, relationship decay, early warning, flag risks, what risks.'

## Purpose

Synthesizes signals from CRM, M365 (WorkIQ), and vault to surface execution, relationship, and delivery risks proactively — before they escalate into pipeline or customer impact.

## Freedom Level

**Medium** — Risk classification requires multi-source judgment; signal collection is tool-based.

## Trigger

- Any role requests risk review or account health check
- Scheduled hygiene cadence for proactive risk surfacing
- Pre-commit or pre-governance risk preparation

## Flow

1. **CRM signals** — Call `msx-crm:crm_get_record` on opportunity + `msx-crm:get_milestones` for milestone state.
2. **M365 signals** — Call `ask_work_iq` with scoped query (apply WorkIQ scoping skill) for communication recency, engagement frequency, and sentiment.
3. **Vault signals** — If vault is available, call `oil:get_vault_context()` for customer notes, prior risk flags, and relationship history.
4. Classify risks by type and severity (see taxonomy below).
5. Generate risk summary with recommended mitigations.

## Risk Taxonomy

| Risk Type | Signal Sources | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Execution** | CRM milestone dates vs today; task completion rate | Milestone overdue by >14 days |
| **Relationship** | M365 communication gap; sentiment shift | No customer contact in 30+ days |
| **Pipeline** | Opportunity age vs stage; stalled progression | Stage 2 for >60 days |
| **Delivery** | Milestone status distribution; at-risk count | >30% milestones at `msp_milestonestatus = 861980001` |
| **Commitment** | Commit recommendation vs evidence | Committed without delivery date |
| **Cross-role** | Missing role engagement per stage model | No CSAM activity on Stage 4 opp |

## Severity Classification

- **Critical**: Evidence of active customer impact or imminent deadline miss
- **High**: Structural gap that will escalate without intervention within 2 weeks
- **Medium**: Pattern suggests risk but no immediate trigger
- **Low**: Informational — monitor in next cadence

## Decision Logic

- Cross-reference ≥2 mediums for each risk (CRM confirms signal, M365 provides evidence, or vault provides history)
- Single-medium risk → flag medium gap, present with lower confidence
- Route each risk to the accountable role for the current stage
- Critical risks → escalation recommendation with minimum intervention

## Output Schema

- `risk_items`: list of risks with type, severity, evidence_sources, accountable_role
- `medium_coverage`: which mediums were queryable and which were not
- `recommended_mitigations`: specific actions per risk with skill references
- `next_action`: names role-appropriate skill for highest-severity risk
