name: expansion-signal-routing
description: 'Upsell/cross-sell router: when a growth signal surfaces during active delivery or post-deployment optimization, captures the signal and routes it to Specialist for net-new deal creation. Chains with adoption-excellence-review and value-realization-pack for full Stage 5 review. Triggers: upsell detected, cross-sell opportunity, growth signal, land-and-expand, new deal from delivery, expansion routing, expansion signals, flag expansion.'
argument-hint: 'Provide opportunityId where upsell/cross-sell signal was observed'

## Purpose

Captures expansion signals identified during Stage 5 delivery or optimization and routes them to Specialist/ATU with CSAM timing and prioritization alignment, preventing premature or duplicate pipeline creation.

## Freedom Level

**Medium** — Signal detection requires judgment; routing rules are exact.

## Trigger

- Expansion signal appears during delivery or adoption execution
- Optimization insight implies business scope change
- User asks "should this be a new opportunity?" or "expansion routing"

## Flow

1. Call `msx-crm:get_milestones` with `opportunityId` — isolate optimize/adoption milestones.
2. Call `msx-crm:get_milestone_activities` for evidence of unmet potential or extension patterns (targeted only).
3. Call `msx-crm:get_my_active_opportunities` to check for existing expansion opportunities (avoid duplicates).
4. Classify signal and determine routing (see below).
5. Generate dry-run actions:
   - `msx-crm:create_task` to route signal to Specialist/ATU
   - `msx-crm:update_milestone` to preserve signal context in current milestone

## Signal Classification

| Signal Type | Example | Route |
|---|---|---|
| Workload expansion | Customer wants to extend to new business unit | Specialist — new Stage 1-2 opportunity |
| Usage growth | Consumption exceeding targets, new use cases emerging | CSAM documents, Specialist evaluates |
| Technology uplift | Architecture modernization or migration need | CSA captures signal, Specialist creates pipeline |
| Renewal with scope change | Renewal includes new workloads or services | Specialist — linked opportunity |

## Decision Logic

- Expansion pipeline action is routed **only after CSAM timing/prioritization alignment is explicit**
- Do not treat signal capture as automatic opportunity creation
- Check for existing expansion opportunities to avoid duplicates
- Preserve signal evidence in current milestone comments before routing

## Output Schema

- `expansion_signals`: detected signals with classification and evidence
- `ownership_route`: CSAM → Specialist routing with timing recommendation
- `duplicate_check`: existing opportunities that may cover this signal
- `dry_run_tasks`: signal routing and preservation payloads
- `next_action`: "Expansion signal routed. Specialist/ATU to evaluate for Stage 1-2 pipeline creation."
