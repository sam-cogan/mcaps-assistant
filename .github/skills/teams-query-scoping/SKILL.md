# Teams Query Scoping

Efficient patterns for the native `teams:*` MCP tools. Prevents payload bloat, unnecessary hops, and confusion around Teams chat topology.

## Purpose

Frontloads chat/channel topology knowledge and provides retrieval strategies that minimize tool calls and payload size when using the Teams MCP server directly (not WorkIQ).

## When to Use

- Retrieving Teams messages for a specific person, topic, or time range
- Discovering which chat or channel contains a conversation
- Posting messages to chats or channels
- Any direct `teams:*` tool call (not `workiq:ask_work_iq`)

## MCP Tools

| Tool | Purpose | Payload Risk |
|---|---|---|
| `teams:SearchTeamsMessages` | Full-text search across all Teams messages | **HIGH** — can return 20KB+ |
| `teams:ListChats` | Lists all chats (1:1, group, meeting) | **MEDIUM** — many results |
| `teams:ListChatMessages` | Messages in a specific chat | **MEDIUM** — unbounded without top/skip |
| `teams:GetChat` | Single chat metadata by ID | LOW |
| `teams:GetChatMessage` | Single message by chat + message ID | LOW |
| `teams:ListTeams` | All joined teams | LOW |
| `teams:ListChannels` | Channels in a specific team | LOW |
| `teams:ListChannelMessages` | Messages in a channel | **MEDIUM** |
| `teams:ListChannelMembers` | Members of a channel | LOW |
| `teams:ListChatMembers` | Members of a chat | LOW |
| `teams:PostMessage` | Send message to a chat | WRITE |
| `teams:PostChannelMessage` | Send message to a channel | WRITE |
| `teams:ReplyToChannelMessage` | Reply in a channel thread | WRITE |
| `teams:CreateChat` | Create a new chat | WRITE |
| `teams:CreateChannel` | Create a team channel | WRITE |
| `teams:CreatePrivateChannel` | Create a private channel | WRITE |

## Teams Chat Topology

Understanding chat types prevents wasted discovery calls.

| Chat Type | `chatType` Value | Discoverable via `ListChats`? | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **1:1 chat** | `oneOnOne` | Yes | Between exactly two people |
| **Group chat** | `group` | Yes | 3+ named participants |
| **Meeting chat** | `meeting` | Yes | Auto-created for scheduled meetings |
| **Self-chat** | N/A (`48:notes`) | **No** | Personal notepad; NOT in `ListChats` results |

### Self-Chat (`48:notes`)

The Teams self-chat (personal notepad / "chat with yourself") uses the special ID format `48:notes`. It is **not** discoverable through `ListChats` or `SearchTeamsMessages`.

**To read self-chat**: `teams:ListChatMessages` with chatId `48:notes` — this may or may not be supported by the MCP server. If it fails, self-chat is not accessible via MCP tools.

**To post to self-chat**: `teams:PostMessage` with chatId `48:notes` — same caveat.

**Fallback**: If the user has a personal scratchpad channel (e.g., a private channel in a team), discover it via `ListTeams` → `ListChannels` (filter by name like "sandbox", "notes", "personal").

## Vault-First UPN Resolution

Teams operations that target a specific person (chat lookup, message send, chat creation) require a UPN or Teams user ID. Direct Graph API or `ListChats` lookups for UPN are **intermittently unreliable** — they fail under throttling, stale tokens, or ambiguous display names.

**Always resolve identity through OIL vault before falling back to Teams API discovery.**

### Resolution Flow

```
Person name known?
  ├─ oil:get_person_context({ name }) → check email / teamsId fields
  │   ├─ email or teamsId present? → USE IT (skip all Teams discovery)
  │   └─ Not present? → fall through to discovery
  │
  ├─ oil:resolve_people_to_customers({ names: [name] })
  │   └─ Resolves customer association but not UPN → use for scoping only
  │
  ├─ calendar:ListCalendarView (recent events) → extract UPN from attendees
  │   └─ Found UPN? → use it AND persist to vault (see below)
  │
  ├─ teams:ListChats() → filter by member displayName
  │   └─ Found userId? → use it AND persist to vault (see below)
  │
  └─ All failed → report to user; do not guess UPNs
```

### Persisting Resolved UPNs to Vault

When a UPN or Teams ID is discovered through calendar events, Teams chat member lists, or user confirmation, **write it back to the vault** so future lookups are instant and API-free:

```
oil:patch_note({
  path: "People/<Person Name>.md",
  heading: "frontmatter",
  content: "email: user@domain.com\nteams_id: <teams-user-id>"
})
```

**Vault person file frontmatter fields:**
- `email` — UPN / email address (e.g., `jane.doe@microsoft.com`)
- `teams_id` — Teams-specific user ID (GUID from chat member metadata)

### Why Vault-First?

| Approach | Reliability | Latency | Token Cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Vault lookup** (`get_person_context`) | High — local file | ~50ms | Minimal |
| Calendar attendee extraction | Medium — depends on recent events | ~500ms | Low |
| `ListChats` → member filter | Medium — intermittent failures, throttling | ~1-3s | Medium |
| Pattern guessing (`first.last@domain`) | Low — fails for non-standard aliases | N/A | None |

## Retrieval Patterns

### Pattern 1: Find Messages by Topic (Narrowest)

```
1. teams:SearchTeamsMessages({ query: "<topic keywords>", top: 10 })
2. If results are large → tighten query with more specific terms
3. Extract chatId/channelId from results for targeted follow-up
```

**Key**: Always use `top` parameter to limit results. Start with 5-10, increase only if needed.

### Pattern 2: Find Messages from a Specific Person

```
1. oil:get_person_context({ name }) → extract email or teamsId
2. If vault has UPN/teamsId → teams:ListChats() → filter by userId (exact match)
3. If vault miss → teams:ListChats() → filter by member displayName
4. Pick the matching chatId (1:1 = oneOnOne type with that person)
5. teams:ListChatMessages({ chatId, top: 20 })
6. If UPN was discovered in step 3 → persist to vault via oil:patch_note
```

**Why vault-first?** `ListChats` + displayName filtering is unreliable under throttling and returns ambiguous matches for common names. Vault-cached UPNs skip the discovery hop entirely.

### Pattern 3: Channel Message Retrieval

```
1. teams:ListTeams() → find team by displayName
2. teams:ListChannels({ teamId }) → find channel by displayName
3. teams:ListChannelMessages({ teamId, channelId, top: 20 })
```

Three hops are unavoidable for channels. Cache `teamId` and `channelId` after first discovery.

### Pattern 4: Broad Topic Discovery (Last Resort)

```
1. teams:SearchTeamsMessages({ query: "<broad terms>", top: 5 })
2. Review summaries/snippets to identify which chats/channels are relevant
3. Drill into specific chats via ListChatMessages
```

**Warning**: This is the pattern most likely to produce oversized payloads. Always cap `top` at 5-10 for discovery.

## Payload Management

### The 28KB Problem

`SearchTeamsMessages` frequently returns payloads exceeding 20KB because message bodies include HTML formatting, adaptive cards, and inline images.

**Mitigations**:
1. **Always set `top`** — never call `SearchTeamsMessages` without a result limit.
2. **Start small** — `top: 5` for discovery, `top: 10-15` for targeted retrieval.
3. **Extract IDs, then drill** — use search results only to identify relevant chatIds/messageIds, then retrieve specific messages individually.
4. **Prefer `GetChatMessage`** — for known message IDs, single-message retrieval avoids payload bloat.

### Chat List Management

`ListChats` returns all chats the user participates in (potentially hundreds). Filtering strategies:

1. **Topic filter**: If the tool supports a `topic` or `filter` parameter, use it.
2. **By chat type**: Filter results by `chatType` (oneOnOne, group, meeting) to narrow.
3. **By member**: If looking for a specific person's chat, match on `members` array after retrieval.
4. **Recency**: Most tools return chats sorted by last activity — the first 10-20 are typically sufficient.

## Decision Logic

### Choosing the Right Retrieval Path

```
Need specific topic? → SearchTeamsMessages (top: 5-10)
  └ Found relevant chatId/channelId? → drill into specific chat/channel
  └ Too many results? → add more keywords, reduce top
  └ No results? → try ListChats + filter by member

Need person's messages? → oil:get_person_context (vault UPN) → ListChats → ListChatMessages
  └ Vault has email/teamsId? → filter ListChats by userId (exact)
  └ Vault miss? → filter by displayName, then persist resolved UPN to vault
  └ Only have display name, no vault file? → match on chat member displayName

Need channel content? → ListTeams → ListChannels → ListChannelMessages
  └ Know team name? → filter ListTeams by displayName
  └ Don't know team? → ListTeams first, present options

Need to post? → See Write Patterns below
```

## Write Patterns

### Posting to a Chat
```
1. Identify chatId (via ListChats or from prior read results)
2. teams:PostMessage({ chatId, content: "<message>", contentType: "text" })
```

### Posting to a Channel
```
1. Identify teamId + channelId (via ListTeams → ListChannels)
2. teams:PostChannelMessage({ teamId, channelId, content: "<message>" })
```

### Replying in a Channel Thread
```
1. Identify teamId + channelId + messageId (parent message)
2. teams:ReplyToChannelMessage({ teamId, channelId, messageId, content: "<reply>" })
```

### Creating a New Chat
```
1. oil:get_person_context({ name }) → extract email or teamsId
2. If vault has userId → use it directly
3. If vault miss → resolve via calendar/ListChats, then persist to vault
teams:CreateChat({ chatType: "oneOnOne", members: [{ userId: "<resolved-user-id>" }] })
```

For group chats, use `chatType: "group"` with multiple members. Resolve all member UPNs via vault before calling CreateChat.

## Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Prevention |
|---|---|
| Searching for self-chat via `ListChats` | Self-chat (`48:notes`) is not in `ListChats`. Use direct ID or find a personal channel. |
| `SearchTeamsMessages` without `top` | Always set `top`. Default responses are unbounded and can exceed 20KB. |
| Assuming search filters by sender | `SearchTeamsMessages` is full-text only. Filter by sender after retrieval, or use chat-first discovery. |
| Multi-hop channel discovery on every call | Cache `teamId` + `channelId` after first resolution. Reuse for the session. |
| Posting to wrong chat type | 1:1 chats use `PostMessage` with chatId. Channels use `PostChannelMessage` with teamId + channelId. |
| Guessing UPNs without vault check | Always check `oil:get_person_context` first. Pattern-guessed UPNs fail for non-standard aliases and waste API calls. |

## Chaining

- **From OIL (vault-first UPN)**: Before person-targeted Teams calls, `oil:get_person_context({ name })` returns cached `email` and `teamsId`. If resolved via Teams API, write back with `oil:patch_note` to prevent future lookup failures.
- **From WorkIQ**: If `workiq:ask_work_iq` identified a relevant Teams conversation but you need the actual messages → extract identifiers and use `teams:ListChatMessages` or `teams:GetChatMessage`.
- **To vault**: After retrieving important Teams decisions, persist via `oil:write_note` or `oil:patch_note`.
- **To CRM**: If a Teams conversation reveals milestone/task status changes, use `msx-crm` (dry-run) write-intent tools.
