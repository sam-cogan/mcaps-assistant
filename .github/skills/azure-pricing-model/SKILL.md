## Purpose

Retrieves and structures Azure service pricing into a normalized, Excel-exportable cost model. Captures compute, storage, networking, licensing, support, and discount dimensions so account teams can present transparent pricing to customers and align cost expectations with opportunity milestones.

## When to Use

- Customer asks "how much will this cost?" for an Azure-based solution
- Specialist or SE needs a cost model to attach to a proof plan or milestone
- Pre-governance pricing review before committing delivery milestones
- Comparing reserved instance vs pay-as-you-go for a customer proposal
- Building a TCO comparison (on-premises vs Azure migration)
- Exporting structured pricing data to Excel for customer-facing delivery

## Freedom Level

**Medium** — Service identification and pricing structure are rule-based; cost optimization recommendations and contextual notes require judgment.

## Runtime Contract

| Tool | Server | Purpose | Required |
|---|---|---|---|
| `pricing_get` | `pricing` (Azure MCP) | Structured retail pricing retrieval — PAYG, RI, Spot, Dev/Test, Savings Plan | **Primary** — preferred when available |
| `fetch_webpage` | built-in | Web fallback for Azure pricing pages | **Fallback** — when Pricing MCP unavailable |
| `crm_get_record` | `msx-crm` | Opportunity details, solution play, estimated ACR | Optional — for opportunity-grounded sizing |
| `get_milestones` | `msx-crm` | Milestone/task data for SKU and quantity extraction | Optional — for opportunity-grounded sizing |
| `get_customer_context` | `oil` | Vault context — prior budgets, architecture decisions, spend baselines | Optional — enriches estimates |

## Medium Availability Probe

Before executing the flow, probe which pricing mediums are reachable:

| Medium | Probe | If unavailable |
|---|---|---|
| **Azure Pricing MCP** | `pricing:pricing_get` with `{ service: "Virtual Machines", sku: "Standard_D2s_v5", region: "eastus" }` — confirm structured pricing returns | Fall back to `fetch_webpage` for pricing pages; flag `pricing_source: web_scrape` |
| **CRM** | `msx-crm:crm_auth_status` | Skip opportunity/milestone sizing; require explicit service list |
| **Vault** | `oil:get_vault_context()` | Skip vault-prefetch; operate CRM-only or explicit list |

Cache probe results. When the Azure Pricing MCP is available, it is the **primary and preferred** pricing source — it returns structured, machine-readable retail pricing with PAYG, RI, Spot, Dev/Test, and Savings Plan data in a single call per SKU.

## Flow

### Phase 1 — Scope the Services

Determine which Azure services need pricing. Use one of these entry points:

| Entry point | How | When |
|---|---|---|
| **Explicit list** | User provides service names directly | User says "price out AKS, Cosmos DB, and Azure OpenAI" |
| **Architecture description** | Parse solution description → extract service names | User describes a solution or shares an architecture doc |
| **From opportunity** | `msx-crm:crm_get_record` on opportunityId → solution play + `msx-crm:get_milestones` → extract service/SKU signals from milestone comments and monthly usage fields | User provides an opportunityId |
| **From proof plan** | Chain from `proof-plan-orchestration` output → extract environment/service requirements | Post-proof cost modeling |

For each identified service, normalize to the canonical Azure service name (e.g., "Kubernetes" → "Azure Kubernetes Service", "SQL" → "Azure SQL Database").

#### Opportunity-Grounded Sizing (when opportunityId provided)

When scoping from an opportunity, extract sizing signals to produce grounded estimates rather than generic tier assumptions:

1. `msx-crm:crm_get_record` on opportunityId — read `estimatedvalue`, solution play, and description.
2. `msx-crm:get_milestones({ opportunityId, includeTasks: true })` — for each milestone:
   - Parse `msp_monthlyuse` for consumption/usage targets (maps to quantity estimates).
   - Read milestone comments for SKU mentions, environment specs, or sizing notes.
   - Read task descriptions for infrastructure requirements (e.g., "provision 3-node AKS cluster", "set up D4s_v5 VMs").
3. `oil:get_customer_context({ customer })` (if vault available) — pull prior architecture decisions, approved SKUs, and spend baselines from vault notes.
4. Build a **service manifest** — each entry has: service name, candidate SKU (if found), estimated quantity/scale, and source (milestone | task | vault | assumption).

This manifest feeds Phase 2 with specific SKUs for grounded pricing rather than generic tier lookups.

### Phase 2 — Gather Pricing Data

For each service in the manifest, retrieve pricing using a tiered strategy:

#### Strategy A: Azure Pricing MCP (preferred — when available)

Call `pricing:pricing_get` per service/SKU. This returns structured retail pricing including PAYG, Reservation, Dev/Test, Spot, and Savings Plan rates.

**Per-service call pattern:**
```
pricing:pricing_get({
  service: "{service name}",       // e.g., "Virtual Machines", "Azure Cosmos DB"
  sku: "{ARM SKU name}",           // e.g., "Standard_D4s_v5" — from manifest or user
  region: "{target region}",       // e.g., "eastus"
  include-savings-plan: true        // includes nested savingsPlan array
})
```

**Response processing — extract and classify each price record:**

| Field | Maps to |
|---|---|
| `retailPrice` where `priceType: "Consumption"` and no Spot/Low Priority in `skuName` | PAYG unit price |
| `retailPrice` where `priceType: "Reservation"`, `reservationTerm: "1 Year"` | RI 1-year total (divide by 8760 for hourly, or by 12 for monthly) |
| `retailPrice` where `priceType: "Reservation"`, `reservationTerm: "3 Years"` | RI 3-year total (divide by 26280 for hourly, or by 36 for monthly) |
| `retailPrice` where `priceType: "DevTestConsumption"` | Dev/Test unit price |
| `skuName` containing "Spot" | Spot pricing |
| `skuName` containing "Low Priority" | Low Priority pricing |
| nested `savingsPlan` array (when `include-savings-plan: true`) | 1-year and 3-year Savings Plan rates |
| `productName` containing "Windows" vs not | OS licensing dimension |

**Batch strategy**: For solutions with multiple services, call `pricing:pricing_get` once per service+SKU combination. These calls are independent and can be parallelized.

**Monthly cost calculation**: `retailPrice (per hour) × 730 hours` for compute. For storage/transactions, use the `unitOfMeasure` field to determine the multiplication factor.

#### Strategy B: Web Fallback (when Pricing MCP unavailable)

Use `fetch_webpage` against Azure pricing pages:
- Base URL pattern: `https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/{service-slug}/`
- Parse the page for pricing tiers, SKU options, and metering dimensions.
- Flag `pricing_source: web_scrape` — data is less structured and may be incomplete.

#### Supplementary Context (always, when available)

1. **Vault context** — `oil:get_customer_context({ customer })`:
   - Prior pricing discussions or approved budgets
   - Existing Azure spend baselines from customer notes
   - Discount/EA agreement context

2. **CRM context** (if opportunityId provided and not already gathered in Phase 1):
   - `msx-crm:crm_get_record` — opportunity value, solution play, estimated ACR
   - Cross-reference `estimatedvalue` against the pricing total as a sanity check

3. **Azure CLI** (if authenticated and user has existing deployments):
   - `az consumption usage list` for actual consumption baselines
   - Use only to validate estimates against real usage — not as the primary pricing source

### Phase 3 — Structure the Pricing Model

Organize pricing data into the normalized schema below. Every Azure service decomposes into these cost dimensions:

#### Cost Dimension Taxonomy

| Dimension | Description | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| **Compute** | Processing capacity — vCPUs, memory, GPU hours | VM SKUs, AKS node pools, App Service plans |
| **Storage** | Data at rest — volume, tier, redundancy | Blob (Hot/Cool/Archive), Managed Disks, Cosmos DB RU storage |
| **Networking** | Data in motion — egress, peering, load balancing | Bandwidth egress, VNet peering, Application Gateway |
| **Transactions** | Per-operation charges — API calls, messages, executions | Cosmos DB RUs, Function executions, Event Grid events |
| **Licensing** | Software/IP costs bundled or separate | SQL Server license (AHUB vs included), Windows Server |
| **Support** | Support plan alignment | Standard, Professional Direct, Unified (EDE-linked) |
| **Discounts** | Pricing reductions | Reserved Instances (1yr/3yr), Savings Plans, EA/CSP rates, Dev/Test pricing |

#### Per-Service Pricing Record

For each service, produce one record:

```
Service: {canonical name}
Region: {target region}
SKU/Tier: {specific SKU or tier}
Dimensions:
  - Compute: {unit} × {unit price} × {estimated quantity} = {monthly cost}
  - Storage: {unit} × {unit price} × {estimated quantity} = {monthly cost}
  - Networking: {unit} × {unit price} × {estimated quantity} = {monthly cost}
  - Transactions: {unit} × {unit price} × {estimated quantity} = {monthly cost}
  - Licensing: {model} = {monthly cost}
Subtotal (pay-as-you-go): {sum}
Subtotal (reserved 1yr): {sum with RI discount %}
Subtotal (reserved 3yr): {sum with RI discount %}
Notes: {scaling triggers, tier thresholds, free-tier limits}
```

### Phase 4 — Contextualize

Add wider context that affects pricing decisions:

1. **Consumption pattern analysis** — Classify each service as:
   - **Steady-state** (predictable load → RI candidate)
   - **Burst** (spiky demand → PAYG or autoscale)
   - **Growth** (ramp-up trajectory → Savings Plan candidate)

2. **Regional variance** — Flag if the target region has pricing differences vs. primary regions (East US, West Europe). Note region pairs for DR cost modeling.

3. **Free tier / included allowances** — Document monthly free amounts per service (e.g., Cosmos DB 1000 RU/s free tier, 250 GB Azure SQL serverless auto-pause).

4. **Scaling triggers** — Document at what thresholds costs step up (e.g., "above 10 DTUs, next tier at 50 DTUs" or "beyond 5 TB, per-GB pricing changes").

5. **Unified/EDE alignment** — If vault context shows Unified Support coverage or EDE assignment, note which services fall under support scope and which would need additional coverage.

6. **Optimization recommendations** — For each service, one sentence on the best cost-optimization lever (RI, right-sizing, tier selection, autoscale config).

### Phase 5 — Generate Excel-Ready Output

Produce the data in a structure that maps directly to the `processing-spreadsheets` skill:

#### Sheet 1: Cost Summary

| Column | Content |
|---|---|
| A: Service | Canonical Azure service name |
| B: SKU/Tier | Selected pricing tier |
| C: Region | Deployment region |
| D: Monthly PAYG | Pay-as-you-go monthly estimate |
| E: Monthly RI 1yr | 1-year reserved estimate |
| F: Monthly RI 3yr | 3-year reserved estimate |
| G: Annual PAYG | D × 12 |
| H: Annual RI 1yr | E × 12 |
| I: Annual RI 3yr | F × 12 |
| J: Optimization Note | One-line recommendation |

**Bottom row**: SUM formulas for columns D–I.

#### Sheet 2: Detailed Breakdown

| Column | Content |
|---|---|
| A: Service | Canonical name |
| B: Dimension | Compute / Storage / Networking / Transactions / Licensing |
| C: Unit | Pricing unit (vCPU/hr, GB/mo, 10K transactions) |
| D: Unit Price | Per-unit price |
| E: Est. Quantity | Estimated monthly usage |
| F: Monthly Cost | D × E |
| G: Notes | Tier thresholds, free allowances, scaling triggers |

#### Sheet 3: Assumptions & Context

| Column | Content |
|---|---|
| A: Parameter | Assumption label |
| B: Value | Assumed value |
| C: Source | Where the assumption comes from |
| D: Sensitivity | Low / Medium / High — impact if assumption changes |

Standard assumptions to include:
- Target region
- Utilization rate (for compute right-sizing)
- Data growth rate (for storage projections)
- Egress volume estimate
- Support tier
- License model (AHUB eligibility)
- Contract type (EA / CSP / PAYG)
- Currency

#### Sheet 4: Comparison (optional, for migration/TCO scenarios)

| Column | Content |
|---|---|
| A: Component | Workload component |
| B: Current (On-Prem) | Current annual cost |
| C: Azure PAYG | Azure annual estimate |
| D: Azure RI 3yr | Azure reserved estimate |
| E: Savings | B − D |
| F: Savings % | E / B |

### Phase 6 — Produce the Spreadsheet

Invoke the `processing-spreadsheets` skill to generate the actual `.xlsx` file:

1. Write a Node.js script using `exceljs` following the sheet structure above.
2. Apply formatting:
   - Header row: bold, #003366 background, white text, frozen row.
   - Currency columns: `$#,##0.00` number format.
   - Percentage columns: `0.0%` format.
   - Conditional formatting: highlight cells where RI savings > 30% in green.
   - Auto-filter on all header rows.
3. Save to the Obsidian vault (see `shared-patterns.instructions.md` § Artifact Output Directory), or the user's specified path.

## Decision Logic

### Pricing Tier Selection Heuristic

When the user hasn't specified a tier, select based on context:

| Signal | Default tier |
|---|---|
| POC / proof-of-concept | Dev/Test or lowest production tier |
| Production workload, <100 users | Standard / General Purpose |
| Production workload, >100 users | Premium / Business Critical |
| ML / AI workload | GPU-optimized SKUs |
| No context | General Purpose, mid-range — flag as assumption |

### Reserved Instance Recommendation

| Consumption pattern | Recommendation |
|---|---|
| Steady-state, >8hr/day utilization | 1-year RI minimum, evaluate 3-year |
| Burst, <4hr/day | PAYG — no reservation |
| Growth ramp | Savings Plan (flexible across SKUs) |
| Unknown | Show both; flag for customer discussion |

## Output Schema

```markdown
# Azure Pricing Model — {solution/customer name}

**Date**: {date}
**Region**: {target region}
**Currency**: USD (or as specified)
**Contract**: {EA / CSP / PAYG}

## Service Summary

| Service | SKU | Monthly PAYG | Monthly RI 1yr | Monthly RI 3yr |
|---------|-----|-------------|----------------|----------------|
| {service} | {sku} | ${amount} | ${amount} | ${amount} |
| **Total** | | **${sum}** | **${sum}** | **${sum}** |

## Key Assumptions
- {assumption}: {value} (sensitivity: {low/med/high})

## Optimization Recommendations
1. {service}: {one-line recommendation}

## Risks & Caveats
- Pricing retrieved {date} — verify before customer-facing use
- Estimates exclude tax, EA-specific discounts, and negotiated rates
- Egress costs are estimates — actual depends on architecture patterns

## Spreadsheet
Generated: `{filename}.xlsx` with sheets: Cost Summary, Detailed Breakdown, Assumptions, {Comparison if TCO}.
```

- `services_priced`: count of services in the model
- `total_monthly_payg`: headline monthly figure
- `total_annual_ri_3yr`: best-case annual figure
- `optimization_levers`: list of per-service recommendations
- `assumptions_flagged`: count of high-sensitivity assumptions
- `next_action`: "Review assumptions with the customer. Chain with `proof-plan-orchestration` to attach cost model to proof milestones, or `value-realization-pack` to track actual vs estimated spend post-deployment."
- `connect_hook_hint`: Impact Area: Customer Value — "Structured Azure pricing model for {solution} covering {n} services — {savings_pct}% potential savings via reserved commitments identified"

## Chaining

| Chain | Direction | When |
|---|---|---|
| `proof-plan-orchestration` → **this skill** | Inbound | Proof plan scoped → cost model needed for budget approval |
| **this skill** → `processing-spreadsheets` | Outbound | Always — produces the .xlsx artifact |
| **this skill** → `value-realization-pack` | Outbound | Post-deployment — compare estimated vs actual spend |
| `account-landscape-awareness` → **this skill** | Inbound | Account review surfaces cost optimization opportunities |
| `customer-outcome-scoping` → **this skill** | Inbound | KPI definition includes cost targets → need pricing baseline |

## Gotchas

- **Pricing MCP vs web scrape**: When the Azure Pricing MCP is available, always prefer it — the data is structured, current, and includes all price types in one call. Web scrape is a fallback only.
- **SKU name precision**: `pricing:pricing_get` requires exact ARM SKU names (e.g., `Standard_D4s_v5`, not `D4s v5`). Normalize before calling.
- **Multi-record responses**: A single `pricing_get` call may return multiple records for the same SKU — different OS (Windows/Linux), different price types (Consumption/Reservation/DevTest), Spot, and Low Priority variants. Filter and classify using `productName`, `priceType`, `skuName`, and `reservationTerm` fields.
- **RI pricing units**: Reservation prices are returned as total cost for the term (1-year or 3-year), not per-hour. Divide by months in term for monthly effective cost.
- **Savings Plan availability**: The `include-savings-plan` flag uses a preview API version. Savings Plan data is primarily available for Linux VMs — if the array is empty, note "Savings Plan not available for this SKU."
- Always include a "last retrieved" date on pricing data — Azure pricing updates monthly.
- Do not present pricing as guaranteed — always caveat with contract type and negotiation disclaimer.
- Free tier limits vary by subscription type (Free, PAYG, EA) — confirm subscription context.
- Some services have no RI option — skip RI columns for those (e.g., Azure Functions consumption plan).
- When opportunity-grounded sizing is used, flag which estimates came from milestone/task evidence vs assumptions — this transparency builds customer trust.
