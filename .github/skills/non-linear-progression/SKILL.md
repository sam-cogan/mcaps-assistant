description: 'Non-linear progression advisor: guides when and how to regress a deal to an earlier MCEM phase after proof failures, scope pivots, or buyer-readiness gaps. Provides re-entry requirements. Chains with commit-gate-enforcement and delivery-accountability-mapping for commit-or-loopback decision. Triggers: loopback, regression, go back, roll back, proof failed rework, scope pivot, re-entry, deal regression, loop back, should we loop back.'
argument-hint: 'Provide opportunityId and describe the triggering event (proof failure, scope change, etc.)'

## Purpose

Guides structured stage loopback when evidence shows the opportunity is not ready to progress — preventing false advancement and preserving execution integrity through deliberate iteration.

## Freedom Level

**Medium** — Loopback assessment requires judgment; loopback patterns are documented.

## Trigger

- Proof failure or incomplete evidence at Stage 3
- Capacity or readiness gaps discovered post-commitment
- User asks "should we go back?" or "this isn't ready"
- Exit criteria validation reveals unmet prerequisites

## Flow

1. Identify current stage and the triggering gap (from `exit-criteria-validation` or user context).
2. Classify the loopback type (see patterns below).
3. Recommend target stage and specific re-entry skills.
4. Generate dry-run actions to document the loopback reason in CRM.

## Common Loopback Patterns

| Trigger | From → To | Re-entry Skill |
|---|---|---|
| Proof fails or is inconclusive | Stage 3 → Stage 2 | `proof-plan-orchestration` |
| Architecture infeasible | Stage 3 → Stage 2 | `architecture-feasibility-check` |
| Capacity/delivery gap post-commit | Stage 4 → Stage 3 | `commit-gate-enforcement` |
| Scope change by customer | Stage 4 → Stage 2 | `pipeline-qualification` + `proof-plan-orchestration` |
| Adoption stall reveals design issue | Stage 5 → Stage 4 | `value-realization-pack` |
| Customer priority shift | Any → Stage 1 | `customer-outcome-scoping` |

## Decision Logic

- Loopback is recommended when VO evidence contradicts current stage positioning
- Document loopback reason in milestone comments before stage change
- Notify accountable roles for both current and target stages
- Loopback is not failure — it preserves long-term execution integrity

## Output Schema

- `loopback_recommended`: boolean
- `from_stage`: current stage
- `to_stage`: recommended target stage
- `reason`: specific evidence driving the loopback
- `re_entry_skill`: skill to invoke at the target stage
- `dry_run_documentation`: CRM update payloads to record loopback
- `next_action`: names the re-entry skill for the target stage
