description: 'CSA guardrail scanner for execution monitoring: audits committed architecture decisions against live dependency state, flags technical constraint breaches and unresolved blockers. Produces a punch-list for delivery integrity. Chains with task-hygiene-flow and unified-constraint-check for SE morning prep. Triggers: guardrail scanner, architecture breach, dependency audit, CSA punch-list, constraint violation, owner-motion mismatch, execution blockers.'
argument-hint: 'Run across CSA-owned committed work or specify opportunityId(s) for targeted scan'

## Purpose

Provides CSA with a risk-classified view of committed milestones, surfacing execution blockers, architecture constraint violations, and owner-motion mismatches that threaten delivery.

## Freedom Level

**Medium** — Risk classification requires judgment; corrective actions are role-specific.

## Trigger

- Daily/weekly execution sweep for committed scope
- User asks "what's at risk?" or "execution status"
- Pre-governance preparation

## Flow

1. Call `msx-crm:crm_auth_status`.
2. Call `msx-crm:get_my_active_opportunities` — single call for all active opportunities.
3. Call `msx-crm:get_milestones` with `opportunityId` per opportunity — filter committed milestones from summary.
4. Call `msx-crm:get_milestone_activities` only for at-risk/blocked candidates from step 3.
5. Classify execution state per milestone.
6. Generate dry-run corrections:
   - `msx-crm:update_milestone` for risk/status/comments
   - `msx-crm:create_task` for follow-up actions

## Execution State Classification

| State | Criteria |
|---|---|
| **On track** | Active tasks with owners, no blockers, date >30 days |
| **At risk** | Date <30 days with incomplete tasks OR missing delivery motion |
| **Blocked** | No active tasks, no recovery plan, OR owner-motion mismatch detected |
| **Owner mismatch** | CSA listed as owner but delivery motion is Partner/ISD/Unified |

## Decision Logic

- Owner-motion mismatch → flag for reassignment, do not absorb delivery PM work
- Technical blockers → CSA-actionable, produce remediation plan
- Delivery/resourcing blockers → route to CSAM or delivery owner
- Commercial/scope issues → route to Specialist
- Escalate when no recovery activity exists for near-term committed milestone

## Output Schema

- `risk_dashboard`: milestone-level status with reason codes
- `remediation_plan`: owner + action + due date per item
- `owner_mismatch_flags`: milestones needing ownership clarification
- `dry_run_operations`: update/task preview payloads
- `next_action`: "Execution sweep complete. Would you like to run `value-realization-pack` for milestones approaching delivery completion?"
