name: exit-criteria-validation
description: 'Exit-criteria validation via VO evidence audit: checks each formal criterion against CRM field evidence (solution play set, BVA complete, success plan linked) and returns pass/fail per item. Flags when BPF position diverges from actual evidence. Chains with mcem-stage-identification, risk-surfacing, and role-orchestration for full deal triage. Triggers: exit criteria, are we ready, Verifiable Outcome check, criteria met, VO audit, BPF evidence mismatch, ready to advance.'
argument-hint: 'Provide opportunityId and the target stage number to validate against'

## Purpose

Checks whether an opportunity meets the formal MCEM exit criteria for its current stage by reading Verifiable Outcomes from CRM entity state — not relying on the Stage field alone.

## Freedom Level

**Medium** — VO interpretation requires judgment; exit criteria checks are rule-based.

## Trigger

- Any role preparing for stage progression
- User asks "are we ready for Stage X?" or "exit criteria check"
- Pre-governance stage readiness validation

## Flow

1. Determine current stage using `mcem-stage-identification` skill.
2. Load exit criteria for current stage from MCEM flow (see criteria below).
3. Call `msx-crm:crm_get_record` on opportunity for stage, solution play, success plan.
4. Call `msx-crm:get_milestones` with `opportunityId` for milestone state.
5. Map achieved Verifiable Outcomes against exit criteria.
6. Report pass/fail per criterion.

## Stage Gate Exit Criteria (VO-based)

| Gate | Criterion | CRM Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| 1→2 | Qualified opportunity | `opportunity.statecode = 0` + `activestageid` past qualification |
| 1→2 | Solution play selected | `opportunity.msp_salesplay ne null` |
| 2→3 | Plays confirmed | `opportunity.msp_salesplay` valid value |
| 2→3 | Business value reviewed | BVA entity `status = Complete` |
| 2→3 | CSP created | `msp_successplan` linked |
| 3→4 | Customer agreement | `opportunity.activestageid` post-commitment |
| 3→4 | Resources aligned | `msp_commitmentrecommendation = 861980001` + `msp_milestonedate` set |
| 4→5 | Solution delivered | `msp_milestonestatus = 861980003` |
| 4→5 | Health metrics agreed | CSP health fields populated |

## Decision Logic

- **All criteria met** → stage progression is supported, recommend next-stage skills
- **Partial** → list specific gaps with remediation actions
- **BPF stage diverges from VO-based stage** → flag discrepancy explicitly
- Route gaps to the accountable role for the current stage

## Output Schema

- `stage_gate`: which gate is being evaluated
- `criteria_results`: pass/fail per criterion with CRM evidence
- `overall_readiness`: ready | not_ready | partial
- `gap_analysis`: specific items blocking progression
- `bpf_vs_vo_discrepancy`: flag if declared stage differs from evidence-based stage
- `next_action`: names the appropriate skill for either gap remediation or next-stage entry
