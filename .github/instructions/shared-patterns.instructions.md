# Shared Patterns for MSX/MCEM Operations

## Shared Definitions

| Term | Definition |
|---|---|
| **Opportunity** | Customer engagement container aligned to MCEM stages |
| **Milestone** | Execution unit (`msp_engagementmilestones`) for commitment, delivery, and usage/consumption outcomes |
| **Uncommitted** | Still shaping; not fully resourced for delivery (`msp_commitmentrecommendation ≠ 861980001`) |
| **Committed** | Customer agreement + internal readiness for execution (`msp_commitmentrecommendation = 861980001`) |
| **Stage 1–5** | MCEM stages: Listen & Consult → Inspire & Design → Empower & Achieve → Realize Value → Manage & Optimize |
| **EDE** | Enhanced Designated Engineer — a dedicated technical resource aligned to a Unified Support package and customer TPID. Tracked in vault `## Unified Coverage`, not CRM |
| **Swarming** | Cross-role collaboration on adjacent pipeline within the same account — working opportunities outside your direct assignment to bring full account value |

## MCEM Unit → Agent Role Mapping

| MCEM Unit | Agent Roles | Stage Accountability |
|---|---|---|
| ATU (Account Team Unit) | Account Executive (out of scope for skills) | Stage 1 lead, co-orchestrates Stage 2 |
| STU (Specialist Team Unit) | **Specialist**, **Solution Engineer (SE)** | Stages 2–3 accountable |
| CSU (Customer Success Unit) | **CSAM**, **Cloud Solution Architect (CSA)** | Stages 4–5 accountable |
| Partners | Referenced contextually | Varies by segment and motion |

## Runtime Contract

- **Read tools are live**: `msx-crm:crm_auth_status`, `msx-crm:crm_whoami`, `msx-crm:get_my_active_opportunities`, `msx-crm:list_accounts_by_tpid`, `msx-crm:list_opportunities`, `msx-crm:get_milestones`, `msx-crm:get_milestone_activities`, `msx-crm:crm_get_record`, `msx-crm:crm_query`, `msx-crm:get_task_status_options`.
- **Write-intent tools are dry-run**: `msx-crm:create_task`, `msx-crm:update_task`, `msx-crm:close_task`, `msx-crm:update_milestone` return `mock: true` preview payloads.
- **No approval-execution tools exposed yet**: treat write outputs as recommended operations pending future staged execution.
- Follow `msx-role-and-write-gate.instructions.md` for mandatory human confirmation before any write-intent operation.

## Upfront Scoping Pattern

Collect scope in minimal calls before per-milestone workflows:

0. **VAULT-PREFETCH** — call `oil:get_customer_context({ customer })` for opportunity GUIDs and context. Skip if OIL unavailable. See `obsidian-vault.instructions.md`.
1. **Prefer `get_milestones` with name resolution** — `msx-crm:get_milestones({ customerKeyword: "Contoso", statusFilter: "active" })` resolves customer → accounts → opportunities → milestones in one call. Add `includeTasks: true` to embed tasks inline.
2. **If vault provided GUIDs** — `msx-crm:get_milestones({ opportunityId })` or `msx-crm:get_milestones({ opportunityIds: [...] })` for batch.
3. `msx-crm:get_milestone_activities(milestoneId)` — only for specific milestones needing deep investigation (or use `includeTasks: true` above).
4. `msx-crm:crm_query` — for ad-hoc OData needs not covered by `get_milestones`. See `crm-query-strategy.instructions.md`.

## WorkIQ MCP Companion

Use `ask_work_iq` when evidence lives in M365 rather than CRM:
- **Sources**: Teams chats/channels, meeting transcripts/notes, Outlook mail/calendar, SharePoint/OneDrive docs.
- **Source separation**: CRM = system-of-record status; WorkIQ = communication and delivery evidence.
- **Scoping**: Always include explicit date range, customer/people, and source types. See `workiq-query-scoping/SKILL.md` for full playbook.
- **Personal attribution**: When gathering evidence for Connect or impact reporting, always include the authenticated user's name/alias (from `crm_whoami`) as a required filter. Account-level outcomes are not personal contributions unless the user appears in the evidence thread. See `workiq-query-scoping/SKILL.md` § Personal Attribution Filter.

## VAULT-PROMOTE (Post-Workflow)

After completing a CRM workflow, persist validated findings to the vault:
- Use `oil:promote_findings()` or `oil:patch_note()` with `heading: "Agent Insights"`.
- If new opportunity GUIDs were discovered, use `oil:update_customer_file()` to add them.
- Skipped automatically if OIL is unavailable.

## Skill Composition Contract

Skills are instruction documents auto-loaded by the runtime when matched, NOT exclusive tool calls. The agent MUST execute multiple skills sequentially in the same turn when the user's request requires outputs from more than one skill. Do NOT defer or refuse with "I can only invoke one skill at a time" — that constraint does not exist.

### How to execute a skill

1. **Locate**: The skill's Flow, Decision Logic, and Output Schema are already in your context when matched by the runtime. If a chained skill (via `next_action`) was not auto-loaded, fall back to `read_file` at `.github/skills/{name}/SKILL.md`.
2. **Execute**: Follow the skill's `## Flow` section — each numbered step maps to one or more MCP tool calls.
3. **Apply**: Use the skill's `## Decision Logic` and `## Output Schema` to classify results and structure output.
4. **Chain**: Read the skill's `next_action`. If the user's request spans the next skill, execute it immediately — do not ask permission.

### Multi-skill prompts

When a user prompt clearly requires multiple skills (e.g., "review adoption, check value realization, and flag expansion"):
1. Identify all required skills from the prompt — matched skills are already loaded.
2. Execute each skill's Flow sequentially, reusing MCP tool call results across skills where the same data is needed.
3. If any required skill was not auto-loaded (not in context), `read_file` it before executing.
4. Produce a combined output with sections labeled per skill.

### Composition rules

- **Same-role chaining**: When a skill's `next_action` names another skill owned by the same role, execute it immediately.
- **Cross-role chaining**: When `next_action` names a skill owned by a different role, present the handoff recommendation but do not block remaining same-role skills.
- **Parallel data gathering**: MCP tool calls that feed multiple skills (e.g., `get_milestones` used by both `milestone-health-review` and `mcem-stage-identification`) should be made once and reused.

### Common multi-skill chains

These chains are pre-validated. When a prompt matches a chain pattern, load and execute all listed skills:

| Chain name | Skills (in order) | Trigger pattern |
|---|---|---|
| Weekly pipeline review | `pipeline-hygiene-triage` → `handoff-readiness-validation` → `risk-surfacing` | "weekly review", "pipeline cleanup + handoff + risks" |
| Pre-governance prep | `mcem-stage-identification` → `milestone-health-review` → `customer-evidence-pack` | "governance meeting prep", "stage + health + evidence" |
| Commit-or-loopback | `commit-gate-enforcement` → `non-linear-progression` → `delivery-accountability-mapping` | "should we commit or loop back" |
| Full deal triage | `mcem-stage-identification` → `exit-criteria-validation` → `risk-surfacing` → `role-orchestration` | "deal stuck", "end-to-end triage" |
| Post-proof handoff | `architecture-feasibility-check` → `architecture-execution-handoff` → `handoff-readiness-validation` | "proof completed, create handoff" |
| Adoption + expansion | `adoption-excellence-review` → `value-realization-pack` → `expansion-signal-routing` | "adoption health + value + expansion" |
| SE morning prep | `task-hygiene-flow` → `execution-monitoring` → `unified-constraint-check` | "SE daily check", "task hygiene + blockers" |
| Account swarming | `account-landscape-awareness` → `account-structure-diagram` → `pipeline-hygiene-triage` | "what else is happening", "swarm opportunities", "full account view", "who else is working" |
| Unified investment scan | `account-landscape-awareness` → `unified-constraint-check` → `pipeline-qualification` | "EDE gaps", "Unified upsell", "package coverage", "where should we invest" |
| Morning brief | `morning-brief` (parallel: vault + CRM + WorkIQ) → `pipeline-hygiene-triage` (optional drill-down) | "morning brief", "start my day", "catch me up", "daily dashboard" |
| Proof cost modeling | `proof-plan-orchestration` → `azure-pricing-model` → `processing-spreadsheets` | "proof cost", "how much will this cost", "Azure pricing for POC" |
| Solution cost proposal | `azure-pricing-model` → `processing-spreadsheets` → `value-realization-pack` | "cost model", "Azure pricing spreadsheet", "pricing document", "TCO comparison" |

## Connect Hook Capture (Post-Action)

After completing any skill that produces measurable outcomes, the agent **passively evaluates** whether the work constitutes impact evidence worth capturing for Microsoft Connects performance reviews.

### When to fire

Fire `oil:capture_connect_hook` when a completed skill produced at least one of:
- A **concrete deliverable** (health report, exception list, handoff document, remediation plan)
- A **measurable improvement** (time saved, errors fixed, milestones unblocked, adoption gaps closed)
- A **process contribution** (new tooling, documentation, onboarding others, cross-team enablement)

Do **not** fire for: pure read/discovery actions, failed scoping attempts, or skills that produced no actionable output.

### Impact area classification

| Impact Area | Skill output signals |
|---|---|
| **Customer Impact** | Direct customer deliverable, adoption lift, milestone delivery, risk mitigation, solution readiness |
| **Business Impact** | Revenue influenced, pipeline progression, forecast accuracy, deal velocity, cost avoidance |
| **Culture & Collaboration** | Process improvement, tooling that scales beyond one person, cross-role coordination, mentoring, knowledge sharing, inclusive practices |

Most skill completions map to **Customer Impact**. Add **Business Impact** when the action influenced pipeline or revenue. Add **Culture & Collaboration** when the action created reusable process, enabled cross-team work, or involved mentoring.

### Capture pattern

After the skill's output is delivered, if a hook is warranted:

1. Derive `customer` from the skill's scoping context (opportunity or vault prefetch).
2. Build `hook` from the skill's structured output — the hook text should be the one-sentence impact summary, evidence from the measurable delta, and source from the skill invocation or CRM record.
3. Call `oil:capture_connect_hook({ customer, hook })`. This is auto-confirmed — no human gate.
4. If OIL is unavailable, skip silently. The hook is opportunistic, not blocking.

Skills may include a `connect_hook_hint` in their Output Schema to pre-classify the likely impact area(s) and hook template. When present, the agent uses the hint to streamline capture. When absent, the agent applies the classification table above.

## Common Output Conventions

- Dry-run write payloads include `mock: true` and the tool name that would execute.
- Every stage-bound skill output includes `next_action` naming the recommended next skill.
- Cross-role `next_action` must name the owning role and recommend engagement (no auto-invoke).
- Risk findings always include: one-sentence risk, evidence source, role to act, minimum intervention.
- `connect_hook_hint` (optional): pre-classified Connects impact area(s) and one-line hook template for passive evidence capture.

### CRM Record Linkification (Mandatory)

Whenever displaying milestones, opportunities, or tasks from MSX CRM, **always include a clickable link** to the CRM record. This applies to all output formats — tables, lists, confirmation packets, health reports, and triage summaries.

**URL pattern:**
```
https://microsoftsales.crm.dynamics.com/main.aspx?etn=<entityLogicalName>&id=<GUID>&pagetype=entityrecord
```

| Entity | `etn` value | GUID source |
|---|---|---|
| Opportunity | `opportunity` | `opportunityid` |
| Milestone | `msp_engagementmilestone` | `msp_engagementmilestoneid` or `id` from `get_milestones` |
| Task | `task` | `activityid` |

**Rendering rules:**
- If `get_milestones` returns a `recordUrl` field, use it directly — do not reconstruct.
- Format as a markdown link with the record name as display text: `[Milestone Name](url)`.
- In tables, use a dedicated "Link" column or make the name column itself a link.
- In confirmation packets and write-gate output, every milestone and task must be linked.
- For tasks, construct the URL from `activityid` when `recordUrl` is not provided: `https://microsoftsales.crm.dynamics.com/main.aspx?etn=task&id=<activityid>&pagetype=entityrecord`.
