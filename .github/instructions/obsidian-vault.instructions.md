# Obsidian Vault — Local Knowledge Layer

The Obsidian vault is the agent's **primary local knowledge store** — personal notes, customer context, durable memory, and known defaults. It is NOT optional scaffolding; it is the lens through which CRM data is scoped and interpreted.

MSX/CRM is the **authoritative system of record** for live state (milestones, opportunities, pipeline). The vault provides the *context* that makes CRM data meaningful: which customers matter, what was discussed, what decisions were made, what the agent should focus on.

## Core Principles

1. **Vault defines scope; CRM provides fresh state.** The vault tells the agent *who* and *what* to care about. CRM tells the agent *where things stand right now*.
2. **Vault-listed customers are the active roster.** If a customer does not have a `Customers/<Name>.md` file in the vault, treat it as out-of-scope for proactive workflows. Past/completed/limbo opportunities for un-tracked customers should be ignored unless the user explicitly asks.
3. **CRM data is always retrieved fresh for complex operations.** Even if the vault has cached findings, milestone/opportunity status must be validated from CRM when the workflow involves writes, risk assessment, governance reporting, or cross-customer analysis.
4. **Vault is the durable storage layer.** Validated findings, decisions, Connect hooks, and agent insights are persisted to the vault. Without the vault, the agent operates statelessly — durable memory requires Obsidian or a user-configured persistence layer.

## Vault Structure Conventions

```
Customers/
  <CustomerName>.md       # One file per actively-tracked customer
People/
  <Full Name>.md          # Contact/stakeholder notes (internal, customer, partner)
Projects/
  <ProjectName>.md        # Cross-customer or internal projects
Meetings/
  <YYYY-MM-DD> - <Title>.md  # Meeting notes, organized by date
Daily/
  <YYYY-MM-DD>.md         # Daily notes (optional)
Weekly/
  <YYYY>-W<XX>.md         # Weekly digest summaries
Templates/
  ...                     # Note templates
```

### Frontmatter Conventions

All note types use YAML frontmatter for structured retrieval via `query_notes` or `search_vault`. Consistent keys enable cross-note queries.

| Key | Used In | Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `tags` | All | `string[]` | Note type classification (`meeting`, `people`, `project`, `customer`, `weekly-digest`) |
| `date` | Meetings, Weekly, Daily | `string` | ISO date (`YYYY-MM-DD`) |
| `customer` | Meetings, Projects | `string` | Customer name — must match a `Customers/` filename |
| `project` | Meetings | `string` | Project name — must match a `Projects/` filename |
| `status` | Meetings, Projects | `string` | `open` / `closed` / `active` / `completed` |
| `action_owners` | Meetings | `string[]` | People with outstanding action items |
| `company` | People | `string` | Organization the person belongs to |
| `org` | People | `string` | `internal` / `customer` / `partner` |
| `customers` | People | `string[]` | Customer accounts they're associated with |

### Customer File Anatomy (`Customers/<Name>.md`)

Each customer file is the single source of local truth for that customer. Sections are additive — create them as content arrives, don't pre-populate empty headings.

| Section | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `# <CustomerName>` | Header — customer name |
| `## Team` | Account team members, roles, stakeholder contacts |
| `## Opportunities` | **Active opportunity names AND GUIDs** (`opportunityid: <GUID>`). This is the primary bridge from customer name → MSX identifiers. Always include the GUID so VAULT-PREFETCH can inject it directly into CRM queries. |
| `## Milestones` | Milestone-level notes, commitments, context not in CRM. Include milestone IDs/numbers when known for direct lookup. |
| `## Agent Insights` | Validated findings promoted from working memory |
| `## Connect Hooks` | Evidence capture entries (see Connect Hooks schema) |
| `## Notes` | Free-form meeting notes, decisions, observations |

**ID Storage Rule**: When the agent discovers MSX identifiers during a CRM workflow (opportunity GUIDs, account IDs, TPIDs, milestone numbers), it MUST write them back to the customer file so future VAULT-PREFETCH steps can use them directly. An opportunity entry without a GUID is incomplete.

### OIL Tool Reference

The vault is managed by the **Obsidian Intelligence Layer (OIL)** MCP server (`oil`). OIL provides 22 domain-specific tools organized into four categories:

#### Orient (read-only context)

| Operation | Tool | Key Parameters |
|---|---|---|
| Vault map & health | `get_vault_context` | *(none)* — returns folder tree, note count, top tags, active customers. **Call first in any new session.** |
| Customer context | `get_customer_context` | `customer` — returns assembled context: opportunities (with GUIDs), team, meetings, action items, insights |
| Person context | `get_person_context` | `person` — returns person profile, customer associations, org type, linked notes |
| Graph traversal | `query_graph` | `path`, `direction`, `depth`, `filter` — backlinks, forward links, N-hop neighborhood |
| People→Customer batch | `resolve_people_to_customers` | `people` array — batch-resolves person names to customer associations |

#### Retrieve (search/query)

| Operation | Tool | Key Parameters |
|---|---|---|
| Unified search | `search_vault` | `query` — 3-tier search: lexical → fuzzy → semantic. Ranked results with scores |
| Frontmatter query | `query_notes` | `where`, `and`, `or`, `order_by`, `limit` — SQL-like frontmatter query |
| Find similar | `find_similar_notes` | `path` or `text` — similarity by tags or semantic embeddings |

#### Write (gated modifications)

| Operation | Tool | Gate | Key Parameters |
|---|---|---|---|
| Append to section | `patch_note` | Auto / Gated | `path`, `heading`, `content`, `operation` — auto-confirmed for "Agent Insights", "Connect Hooks" |
| Connect evidence | `capture_connect_hook` | Auto | `customer`, `hook` — appends to customer file + backup |
| Audit trail | `log_agent_action` | Auto | `action`, `detail` — writes to `_agent-log/` |
| Meeting note | `draft_meeting_note` | Gated | `customer`, `date`, `attendees` — generates from template |
| Update customer | `update_customer_file` | Gated | `customer`, `section`, `content` — proposes frontmatter/section changes |
| Create customer | `create_customer_file` | Gated | `customer` — scaffolds new customer file |
| Write note | `write_note` | Gated | `path`, `content` — low-level write, always gated |
| Batch tags | `apply_tags` | Gated | `paths`, `action`, `tags` — batch tag add/remove |
| Manage pending | `manage_pending_writes` | — | `action` — list, confirm, or reject queued writes |

#### Composite (multi-step workflows)

| Operation | Tool | Key Parameters |
|---|---|---|
| CRM prefetch | `prepare_crm_prefetch` | `customers` array — extracts GUIDs/TPIDs and returns pre-built OData filter strings |
| Entity correlation | `correlate_with_vault` | `entities` — batch-resolves external entities (people, meetings) against vault notes |
| Promote findings | `promote_findings` | `findings` array — batch-promotes validated findings to customer files |
| Vault health | `check_vault_health` | *(none)* — surfaces stale insights, missing IDs, incomplete sections, orphaned notes |
| Drift report | `get_drift_report` | *(none)* — compares vault snapshots against expected CRM state |

## Vault Protocol Phases

Skills reference these phases by name (e.g., "run VAULT-PREFETCH") instead of duplicating vault logic. Each phase includes an **availability guard** — if OIL is unreachable, the phase is skipped gracefully and the workflow continues with fallback behavior.

### Availability Guard (all phases)

Before executing any vault phase:
1. Attempt `get_vault_context()` — this returns the vault map (folder tree, note count, top tags, active customers).
2. If reachable → proceed with the phase.
3. If unreachable → skip the phase, apply the phase-specific fallback, and continue the workflow without breaking.

Cache the availability result for the duration of the current workflow — do not re-check on every phase invocation within the same turn.

### VAULT-PREFETCH

**When**: Before any CRM query or multi-customer workflow. **This is mandatory when OIL is available** — do not skip it in favor of going directly to CRM tools.
**Purpose**: Resolve customer→MSX identifiers from vault notes so CRM queries use precise IDs instead of broad discovery.

Steps:
1. Run availability guard.
2. Call `get_vault_context()` to identify the active customer roster.
3. If targeting a specific customer, call `get_customer_context({ customer: "<Name>" })` — this returns assembled context in one call:
   - **Opportunity GUIDs** (e.g., `opportunityid: 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000`). These go directly into CRM `$filter` expressions (`_msp_opportunityid_value eq '<GUID>'`).
   - **Account TPID / Account ID** — use for account-scoped CRM filters.
   - **Milestone IDs or numbers** if previously recorded.
   - **Team composition** — identifies relevant owners for `_ownerid_value` filters.
   - **Prior Agent Insights** — avoid re-running queries for already-validated findings.
4. For CRM-ready OData filters, use `prepare_crm_prefetch({ customers: ["<Name>"] })` — returns pre-built filter strings ready to paste into `crm_query`.
5. For multi-customer workflows, call `prepare_crm_prefetch({ customers: ["Contoso", "Fabrikam", ...] })` to collect all relevant IDs in one pass.

**Critical rule**: If the vault has the opportunity GUID for a customer, use it directly. Do NOT call `list_opportunities({ customerKeyword })` or `crm_query` on `accounts` to rediscover an ID the vault already provides.

**Skip when**: User provides an explicit opportunity/milestone ID, or asks to search beyond tracked customers.
**Fallback (no vault)**: Ask user for customer names, or use `crm_whoami` + `get_my_active_opportunities()` for scope.

### VAULT-CORRELATE

**When**: After retrieving M365/WorkIQ evidence or CRM data that may relate to existing vault notes (meetings, decisions, action items).
**Purpose**: Cross-reference retrieved activities with vault notes for richer context, and resolve people/entities to customer associations.

Steps:
1. Run availability guard.
2. **People→Customer resolution**: Call `resolve_people_to_customers({ people: [...] })` to batch-resolve person names to customer associations. This enables attributing M365 activity (meetings, chats, emails) to specific customer accounts based on who participated.
3. For richer correlation, call `correlate_with_vault({ entities: [...] })` — batch-resolves external entities (people, meetings from M365) against vault notes with confidence scoring.
4. Search vault by customer name and date range using `query_notes` (frontmatter `customer` + `date` fields). Use resolved customer names from step 2 to target searches.
5. Surface connections: prior meeting notes, decisions, and action items that relate to the retrieved evidence.
6. Return the people→customer lookup to the calling workflow for downstream attribution (e.g., WorkIQ entity resolution, output grouping by customer).

**Date/time boundary rules**:
- Always scope vault searches to the **same date window** as the source query (e.g., if WorkIQ was scoped to today, search vault for today's date only).
- Never let vault correlation silently expand the time window — if a broader search is needed, state the expanded range explicitly to the user.
- Use ISO date format (`YYYY-MM-DD`) in all time-based vault queries.

**Skip when**: No M365/WorkIQ evidence was retrieved, or vault context wouldn't add value to the current output.
**Fallback (no vault)**: Skip correlation; present M365/CRM evidence as-is without vault enrichment.

### VAULT-PROMOTE

**When**: After completing a CRM query or write workflow with validated findings worth persisting.
**Purpose**: Persist validated findings to the vault for future context.

Steps:
1. Run availability guard.
2. Use `promote_findings()` to batch-promote validated findings to customer files. This auto-confirms for designated sections ("Agent Insights", "Connect Hooks") and gates other sections for review.
3. Include datestamp (`YYYY-MM-DD`) and brief summary of what was found or changed.
4. If no customer file exists and the customer is now actively tracked, use `create_customer_file({ customer: "<Name>" })` to scaffold it with the findings.
5. For Connect hooks: use `capture_connect_hook({ customer: "<Name>", hook: { ... } })` — this appends to the customer file and creates a backup automatically.

**Do NOT promote**: speculative, unvalidated, or redundant information.
**Fallback (no vault)**: Write to `.connect/hooks/hooks.md` only. Durable memory is not available without a configured persistence layer.

### VAULT-HYGIENE

**When**: Periodic review, governance cadence, or on-demand cleanup.
**Purpose**: Keep vault data current and aligned with CRM reality.

Steps:
1. Run availability guard.
2. Call `check_vault_health()` — this surfaces stale insights, missing IDs, incomplete sections, and orphaned notes in one call.
3. Cross-reference the vault health report with `get_my_active_opportunities()` — flag gaps (CRM customers not in vault, vault customers with no active CRM opps).
4. For deeper analysis, call `get_drift_report()` to compare vault snapshots against expected CRM state.
5. Recommend additions/removals to the user — do not auto-delete vault content.

**Skip when**: Not explicitly requested or not part of a governance cadence.
**Fallback (no vault)**: Ask the user for customer names or use `crm_whoami` context. No automatic roster approximation without a configured persistence layer.

## Quick Reference: Vault–CRM Interaction Patterns

> Skills should invoke the named Vault Protocol Phases above. This section provides a condensed lookup for common patterns.

| Scenario | Phase | Key Pattern |
|---|---|---|
| Before any CRM query | VAULT-PREFETCH | `get_customer_context` → extract GUIDs → CRM `$filter` |
| After M365/WorkIQ retrieval | VAULT-CORRELATE | `resolve_people_to_customers` → `correlate_with_vault` |
| After validated CRM findings | VAULT-PROMOTE | `promote_findings` → customer file `## Agent Insights` |
| Connect evidence capture | VAULT-PROMOTE | `capture_connect_hook` → customer file + backup |
| Multi-customer scope | VAULT-PREFETCH | Vault roster → `prepare_crm_prefetch` → scoped CRM queries |
| Periodic cleanup | VAULT-HYGIENE | `check_vault_health` → `get_drift_report` → user review |

**Freshness rule**: Use vault for *who/what/why* context. Use CRM for *current state*. Vault scopes first, CRM validates second.

**Customer roster rule**: Vault-listed customers are the active scope for proactive workflows. Un-tracked customers are excluded unless the user explicitly asks.

## Fallback Behavior (No Vault)

> The Vault Protocol Phases above include per-phase fallback instructions. This section provides the consolidated fallback reference.

When OIL is unreachable (availability guard fails):
- The agent operates **statelessly** — no persistent memory across sessions. CRM remains the source of truth for live state.
- CRM query scoping reverts to asking the user for customer names or using `crm_whoami` context.
- Connect hooks go to `.connect/hooks/hooks.md` only.
- Vault correlation (VAULT-CORRELATE) is skipped — present M365/CRM evidence without vault enrichment.
- Users who want cross-session persistence without Obsidian can configure their own memory layer (local files, another MCP server, etc.). The agent does not assume any specific fallback directory structure.

## Anti-Patterns

- **Treating vault as optional** — when configured, it IS the local knowledge layer. Don't ignore it and query CRM blind.
- **Stale vault over fresh CRM** — vault context is for scoping and narrative. Never use cached vault data as a substitute for live CRM status when accuracy matters.
- **Querying all CRM data without vault scoping** — if the vault has a customer roster, use it. Don't `get_milestones(mine: true)` to retrieve everything when the vault tells you which 5 customers matter.
- **Promoting unvalidated data to vault** — only write confirmed findings, decisions, and evidence to vault files. Working hypotheses should be discarded at session end, not persisted.
- **Creating vault files for transient customers** — only create `Customers/<Name>.md` for customers the user intends to actively track. One-off CRM lookups don't warrant a vault file unless the user says so.
