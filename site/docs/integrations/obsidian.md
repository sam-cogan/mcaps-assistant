# Obsidian Vault Integration (OIL)

The **Obsidian Intelligence Layer (OIL)** turns your local Obsidian vault into a durable knowledge layer for AI agents. Instead of starting every conversation from scratch, OIL gives agents persistent memory — customer context, meeting history, relationship maps, and accumulated insights.

!!! info "Don't use Obsidian?"
    Everything works without it. The system operates statelessly (CRM-only) and you can bring your own persistence layer if desired.

---

## Why Obsidian?

- **100% local** — your notes never leave your machine
- **Graph-based** — wikilinks give OIL a pre-built relationship graph (people ↔ customers ↔ meetings)
- **Markdown-native** — plain `.md` files you own forever
- **Works offline** — Obsidian doesn't even need to be running; OIL reads the folder directly

---

## Setup

### 1. Build OIL

```bash
cd mcp/oil
npm install
npm run build
cd ../..
```

### 2. Enable in MCP Config

Open `.vscode/mcp.json` and uncomment the `"oil"` block:

```jsonc
"oil": {
    "type": "stdio",
    "command": "node",
    "args": ["mcp/oil/dist/index.js"],
    "env": {
        "OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH": "${input:obsidianVaultPath}"
    }
}
```

### 3. Start the Server

Click **Start** on `oil` in VS Code. When prompted, enter the absolute path to your vault.

## Vault Structure

OIL expects this minimal folder structure:

```
YourVault/
├── Customers/       # One .md per customer (e.g., Contoso.md)
├── People/          # One .md per contact (e.g., Alice Smith.md)
├── Meetings/        # Meeting notes with wikilinks
└── oil.config.yaml  # Optional — customize paths and fields
```

See `mcp/oil/bench/fixtures/vault/` for example template files.
