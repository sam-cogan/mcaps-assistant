# Skills & Instructions

Copilot's domain expertise comes from plain Markdown files in `.github/`. These files teach Copilot the MCEM process model, role accountability rules, CRM query patterns, and domain playbooks.

## The 4-Tier Context Model

| Tier | Location | When Loaded | Best For |
|------|----------|-------------|----------|
| **Tier 0** | `copilot-instructions.md` | Every single turn | Global rules, routing, response style (~80 lines max) |
| **Tier 1** | `instructions/*.instructions.md` | When request matches `description` keywords | Operational contracts, workflow gates, schemas |
| **Tier 2** | `skills/*/SKILL.md` | When request matches `name`/`description` | Deep role playbooks, domain expertise |
| **Tier 3** | `documents/` | Only when explicitly read via tool call | Large reference material, specs, protocol docs |

**Rule of thumb:** Put universals in Tier 0, conditionals in Tier 1, role-specific depth in Tier 2, and bulky references in Tier 3.

## How Keyword Matching Works

Each instruction and skill file has YAML frontmatter with a `description` field. Copilot matches your prompt text against these descriptions to decide which files to load.

**Example:**

```yaml
---
name: milestone-health-review
description: 'Reviews committed milestone health, date drift, overdue 
  completions. Triggers: milestone health, governance prep, how are my 
  milestones, weekly status.'
---
```

When you ask _"How are my milestones doing?"_, Copilot sees the keyword overlap and loads this skill.

!!! tip "If a skill isn't activating"
    Check the `description` field. Does it contain words you'd actually use in your prompt? Add more trigger phrases.

## Role Cards (Tier 1)

Role cards define each MCAPS role's identity, accountability, and boundaries:

| Role Card | Who It's For |
|-----------|-------------|
| `role-card-specialist.instructions.md` | Pipeline creation, opportunity qualification |
| `role-card-se.instructions.md` | Technical proof execution, task hygiene |
| `role-card-csa.instructions.md` | Architecture oversight, delivery ownership |
| `role-card-csam.instructions.md` | Customer success, adoption, governance |

## Atomic Skills (Tier 2)

## Skill Chaining

Skills can chain together. Each skill's documentation specifies which other skills it chains with:

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   :material-chart-timeline:{ .lg .middle } **Weekly Pipeline Review**

    ---

    `pipeline-hygiene-triage` :octicons-arrow-right-16: `handoff-readiness-validation` :octicons-arrow-right-16: `risk-surfacing`

-   :material-shield-check:{ .lg .middle } **Pre-Governance Prep**

    ---

    `mcem-stage-identification` :octicons-arrow-right-16: `milestone-health-review` :octicons-arrow-right-16: `customer-evidence-pack`

-   :material-gate:{ .lg .middle } **Commit Decision**

    ---

    `commit-gate-enforcement` :octicons-arrow-right-16: `non-linear-progression` :octicons-arrow-right-16: `delivery-accountability-mapping`

</div>

You don't need to specify chains — just describe the outcome you want and Copilot orchestrates the right sequence.
