## MSX CRM Tools

The core tools for interacting with your MSX pipeline:

### Read Tools

### Write Tools :material-alert:

All write tools use the **Stage → Review → Execute** pattern. Nothing is written to CRM without your explicit approval.

|------|-------------|
| `ask_work_iq` | Searches across Teams, Outlook, SharePoint, and meeting transcripts |
| `accept_eula` | Accepts the WorkIQ EULA (required on first use) |

WorkIQ can search:

- **Teams** — chat/thread decisions, channel updates, action ownership

## OIL Tools (Obsidian Vault)

See [Obsidian Integration](../integrations/obsidian.md) for the full 22-tool reference.

---

## Server Configuration

Servers are defined in `.vscode/mcp.json`. Each entry specifies:

- **type** — `stdio` (local process) or `sse` (network)
- **command** — what to run (e.g., `node mcp/msx/src/index.js`)
- **env** — environment variables (CRM URL, tenant ID, etc.)

!!! warning "Security"
    Prefer `stdio` servers that run locally. Never expose MCP servers over the network. See [Adding MCP Servers](../customization/mcp-servers.md) for the full security checklist.
