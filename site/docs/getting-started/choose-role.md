# Choose Your Role

<div class="step-indicator" markdown>
<span class="step done">1. Prerequisites ✓</span>

</div>

Copilot automatically detects your role from CRM, but you can also tell it explicitly. This takes 30 seconds and dramatically improves the relevance of its guidance.

---

## Auto-Detect (Recommended)

Just type:

```
/my-role
```

Copilot calls `crm_whoami`, looks at your role assignments, and confirms what it found. It then shows you a menu of actions tailored to your role.

---

## Or Tell It Directly

If auto-detection doesn't work or you want to set context explicitly:

```
I'm a Specialist. What should I focus on today?
```
